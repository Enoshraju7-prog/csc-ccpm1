# PRD: Content Supply Chain with CCPM (CSC-CCPM1)

## Executive Summary

**Product Vision**
Build a modular, AI-powered Content Supply Chain (CSC) system using Claude Code Project Management (CCPM) that streamlines and automates end-to-end pharmaceutical marketing campaign workflows through intelligent agent orchestration.

**Key Value Proposition**
- Reduce campaign creation time by 60% through intelligent automation
- Achieve 80% MLR approval rate on first submission via automated compliance checking
- Enable seamless workflow from ideation to activation in under 48 hours
- Implement using LangGraph ReAct agents with A2A protocol for maximum flexibility

## Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points**
- Manual handoffs between content creation, MLR review, and campaign activation create bottlenecks
- Lengthy approval cycles for pharmaceutical content slow time-to-market
- Disconnected systems (Veeva, SFMC, Adobe tools) require manual integration
- Lack of intelligent content suggestion based on historical performance data
- Time-consuming audience segmentation and journey setup processes

**Business Impact**
- Extended campaign turnaround times affecting competitive positioning
- Resource inefficiency due to manual, repetitive processes
- Compliance risks from human error in content review
- Lost opportunities due to slow response to market trends
