# Task 004: Orchestrator Agent Core

**Created:** 2025-09-24T09:47:25Z
**Epic:** csc-ccpm1
**Status:** open
**Assignee:** TBD
**Priority:** high
**Effort:** 16-24 hours
**Depends on:** [003]
**Parallel:** false

## Summary

Implement the central Orchestrator Agent that coordinates all pharmaceutical campaign management workflows using LangGraph ReAct pattern. This agent serves as the primary interface for user interactions and manages the delegation of tasks to specialized domain agents.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Orchestration
- [ ] Implement LangGraph ReAct pattern with state management
- [ ] Create workflow stage detection system (discovery, planning, execution, review)
- [ ] Build agent delegation mechanism with load balancing
- [ ] Implement user interaction handling with context preservation
- [ ] Create workflow history tracking and audit logging

### Agent Communication
- [ ] Integrate A2A protocol for inter-agent communication
- [ ] Implement message routing and response aggregation
- [ ] Create agent health monitoring and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Build concurrent task coordination system
- [ ] Implement result synthesis from multiple agents

### User Interface
- [ ] Create conversational interface with natural language processing
- [ ] Implement progress tracking and status updates
- [ ] Build error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Create session management with workflow persistence
- [ ] Implement user preference learning and adaptation

### Workflow Management
- [ ] Create campaign lifecycle management system
- [ ] Implement approval workflow routing
- [ ] Build deadline tracking and notification system
- [ ] Create resource allocation and scheduling
- [ ] Implement performance metrics collection

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- **Framework:** LangGraph with ReAct pattern implementation
- **State Management:** Persistent workflow state with Redis/SQLite
- **Communication:** A2A protocol integration for agent coordination
- **Concurrency:** Async/await pattern for parallel agent operations
- **Logging:** Comprehensive audit trail with structured logging

### Integration Points
- **A2A Protocol:** Agent-to-agent communication layer
- **User Interface:** RESTful API and WebSocket for real-time updates
- **Database:** Campaign data persistence and workflow state
- **External Services:** Authentication and authorization systems
- **Monitoring:** Performance metrics and health checks

### Data Models
```python
class WorkflowState:
    session_id: str
    current_stage: WorkflowStage
    active_agents: List[AgentReference]
    context_stack: List[ConversationContext]
    approval_chain: List[ApprovalStep]

class AgentDelegation:
    target_agent: AgentType
    task_specification: TaskSpec
    priority_level: int
    timeout_duration: int
    callback_handler: CallbackFunction
```

### Performance Targets
- **Response Time:** < 2s for workflow coordination
- **Throughput:** Handle 50+ concurrent campaign workflows
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation
- **Scalability:** Support for 100+ agents in ecosystem

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **ReAct Engine:** LangGraph-based reasoning and action framework
2. **Workflow Coordinator:** Campaign lifecycle management system
3. **Agent Dispatcher:** Load-balanced task delegation mechanism
4. **Context Manager:** User interaction and session persistence
5. **Response Synthesizer:** Multi-agent result aggregation

### Key Algorithms
- **Stage Detection:** Pattern matching on user input and workflow history
- **Agent Selection:** Capability-based routing with performance weighting
- **Load Balancing:** Round-robin with health-based failover
- **Conflict Resolution:** Priority-based task scheduling and resource allocation

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation:** Fallback to core functionality when agents unavailable
- **Retry Mechanisms:** Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breakers:** Prevent cascade failures in agent network
- **User Feedback:** Clear error messages with recovery suggestions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] ReAct pattern implementation validation
- [ ] Workflow state transitions and persistence
- [ ] Agent delegation and response handling
- [ ] Error scenarios and recovery mechanisms

### Integration Tests
- [ ] A2A protocol communication verification
- [ ] Multi-agent workflow coordination
- [ ] Database operations and state persistence
- [ ] Authentication and authorization flows

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Concurrent workflow handling capacity
- [ ] Agent delegation latency measurements
- [ ] Memory usage under sustained load
- [ ] Response time optimization validation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Agent Network Failures:** Implement robust circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms
- **State Consistency:** Use transactional operations for critical state changes
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Implement caching and async processing patterns
- **Integration Complexity:** Create comprehensive API documentation and testing

### Operational Risks
- **Deployment Complexity:** Use containerization and infrastructure as code
- **Monitoring Gaps:** Implement comprehensive observability stack
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Regular security audits and dependency updates
- **Scalability Limits:** Design for horizontal scaling from day one

## Dependencies

### Internal
- **[003] A2A Communication Protocol:** Required for agent coordination
