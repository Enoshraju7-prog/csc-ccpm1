# Task 008: Salesforce Integration Agent

## Overview

Implement the SF Agent for audience segmentation, journey creation, and SFMC integration. This agent provides the final step in the content supply chain by activating approved campaigns with targeted audiences.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core SF Agent Implementation
- [ ] **Agent Class Structure**: Create SF Agent with ReAct pattern and required tools
  - Audience segmentation based on natural language prompts
  - Journey creation and configuration capabilities
  - SFMC data extension management
  - Campaign activation and monitoring
  - Integration with mock Salesforce CDP and SFMC services

### Audience Segmentation Tools
- [ ] **SF Audience Segmentation Tool**: Natural language to audience criteria conversion
  - Parse natural language descriptions ("oncologists who engaged with MoA content")
  - Map to CDP data structure and segmentation rules
  - Validate segment size and targeting feasibility
  - Return audience IDs and segment metadata

- [ ] **CDP Data Access Tool**: Interface with mock Salesforce CDP
  - Query HCP data based on segmentation criteria
  - Support complex filters (specialty, engagement history, prescription behavior)
  - Return structured audience data with demographics
  - Handle data privacy and access controls

### Journey and Campaign Management
- [ ] **SF Journey Activation Tool**: Create and configure customer journeys
  - Accept approved content URLs and audience segment IDs
  - Configure journey timing, personalization rules, and exit criteria
  - Set up A/B testing parameters if specified
  - Validate journey configuration before activation

- [ ] **SFMC Data Extension Manager**: Manage marketing cloud data structures
  - Create data extensions for audience segments
  - Update subscriber lists with segmented audience data
  - Handle data synchronization and refresh cycles
  - Maintain data quality and deduplication

### Campaign Activation System
- [ ] **Campaign Monitoring Tool**: Track campaign performance and status
  - Monitor journey activation status and progression
  - Track email delivery, open, and click metrics
  - Generate performance reports and alerts
  - Provide real-time status updates to orchestrator

- [ ] **Performance Tracking Tool**: Analyze campaign effectiveness
  - Collect engagement metrics across journey touchpoints
  - Compare performance against historical benchmarks
  - Generate insights for future campaign optimization
  - Support attribution analysis across multiple channels

## Technical Implementation

### Mock Services Integration
- [ ] **Mock Salesforce CDP Service**: Simulate CDP data and segmentation
  - RESTful API endpoints for audience queries
  - JSON data structure with HCP profiles and behavior data
  - Support for complex segmentation criteria and filters
  - Realistic response times and data volumes

- [ ] **Mock SFMC Service**: Simulate Marketing Cloud functionality
  - Journey creation and management endpoints
  - Data extension CRUD operations
  - Campaign activation and monitoring APIs
  - Email delivery simulation with realistic metrics

### Agent Architecture
- [ ] **ReAct Pattern Implementation**: Structured reasoning and tool usage
  - Natural language prompt parsing for audience requirements
  - Multi-step journey configuration with validation
  - Error handling and recovery for failed operations
  - Context preservation across multi-turn interactions

- [ ] **A2A Protocol Integration**: Communication with other agents
  - Receive approved content from MLR Agent
  - Send activation status to Orchestrator Agent
  - Handle workflow coordination and error propagation
  - Support parallel operations with other agents

## Data Structures

### HCP Segment Data Model
```json
{
  "segment_id": "seg_001",
  "name": "Engaged Oncologists - Product X",
  "description": "Oncologists who engaged with MoA content but haven't prescribed Product X",
  "criteria": {
    "specialty": ["oncology", "hematology"],
    "engagement_history": {
      "content_types": ["mechanism_of_action"],
      "timeframe": "last_90_days"
    },
    "prescription_behavior": {
      "product_x_prescribed": false,
      "competitor_products": ["product_y", "product_z"]
    }
  },
  "size": 1247,
  "created": "2025-09-24T09:47:25Z"
}
```

### Journey Configuration Schema
```json
{
  "journey_id": "journey_001",
  "name": "Product X MoA Educational Series",
  "audience_segment": "seg_001",
  "content_assets": [
    {
      "type": "email",
      "template_url": "https://storage/approved/email_001.html",
      "subject": "Understanding Product X's Mechanism of Action"
    }
  ],
  "schedule": {
    "type": "triggered",
    "delay": "2_hours",
    "frequency": "weekly"
  },
  "personalization": {
    "specialty_specific": true,
    "engagement_based": true
  },
  "exit_criteria": {
    "prescription_event": true,
    "opt_out": true,
    "max_duration": "90_days"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Audience Segmentation Errors
- [ ] **Invalid Criteria Handling**: Clear messaging for unsupported segmentation rules
- [ ] **Empty Segment Recovery**: Alternative suggestions when segments are too small
- [ ] **Data Access Failures**: Graceful degradation when CDP services unavailable

### Journey Activation Errors
- [ ] **Content Validation**: Verify approved content exists and is accessible
- [ ] **Journey Conflicts**: Detect and resolve overlapping journey configurations
- [ ] **SFMC Service Failures**: Queue operations and retry with exponential backoff

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] **Tool Function Tests**: Individual tool validation with mock data
- [ ] **Agent Logic Tests**: ReAct pattern implementation and decision making
- [ ] **Data Transformation Tests**: Natural language to technical criteria conversion

### Integration Tests
- [ ] **Mock Service Tests**: Full integration with mock CDP and SFMC services
- [ ] **A2A Communication Tests**: Agent-to-agent message passing and workflow
- [ ] **End-to-End Journey Tests**: Complete flow from segmentation to activation

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Mock Salesforce CDP service (implemented in parallel)
- Mock SFMC service (implemented in parallel)
- Content URLs from MLR Agent approval workflow
- A2A protocol implementation from task [4]

### Data Dependencies
- HCP demographic and behavior data (`hcp_segments.json`)
- Historical campaign performance data (`campaign_history.json`)
- Product information for targeting rules (`products.json`)

## Success Metrics

### Functional Success
- Natural language audience descriptions convert to valid segments 95% of the time
- Journey activation completes within 5 minutes of receiving approved content
- Campaign monitoring provides real-time status updates with < 30 second latency

### Performance Success
- Support concurrent journey creation for up to 10 campaigns
- Handle audience segments up to 50,000 HCP records without degradation
- Process complex segmentation criteria (5+ filters) within 10 seconds

### Integration Success
- A2A communication success rate > 99% with other agents
- Mock service integration maintains data consistency across operations
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms handle 100% of transient failures

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Considerations
- Design for eventual production SFMC integration with minimal code changes
- Implement caching layer for frequently accessed audience data
- Support batch operations for large audience segments
- Maintain audit trail for all segmentation and activation decisions

### Compliance Requirements
- Ensure HCP data access follows privacy and consent rules
- Log all audience segmentation decisions for regulatory audit
- Implement data retention and deletion policies for campaign data
- Validate campaign activation against industry compliance standards

This task creates the final piece of the campaign activation pipeline, enabling seamless transition from approved content to active marketing campaigns with targeted HCP audiences.
