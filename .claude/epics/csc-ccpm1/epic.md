# Epic: Content Supply Chain with CCPM (CSC-CCPM1)

## Overview

Build an AI-powered pharmaceutical marketing automation system using LangGraph ReAct agents and A2A protocol to streamline content workflows from ideation to campaign activation. The system orchestrates 5 specialized agents to achieve 60% time reduction in campaign creation while maintaining 80% MLR compliance approval rates.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Framework Selection
- **LangGraph ReAct Pattern**: Enables stateful reasoning with tools-based approach (no hardcoded workflows)
- **A2A Protocol**: Provides standardized inter-agent communication for scalable orchestration
- **Python 3.10+ Stack**: Leverages LangChain ecosystem for rapid development
- **Mock-First Development**: Enables parallel development while external integrations are established

### Agent Architecture Pattern
- **Orchestrator-Supervised Model**: Central coordinator delegates to specialized agents
- **Event-Driven State Management**: Real-time status updates across workflow stages
- **Tool-Based Agent Design**: Each agent equipped with specific tools for their domain
- **Conversation Context Preservation**: LangGraph maintains state across multi-turn interactions

### Integration Strategy
- **API-First External Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 and Tavily for core intelligence
- **Mock Service Layer**: Veeva Vault, SFMC, S3, Salesforce CDP simulators
- **Environment-Based Configuration**: Secure API key management via .env files
- **JSON Data Persistence**: Local file-based storage for development and testing

## Technical Approach

### Agent Coordination System
**Orchestrator Agent** (Central Intelligence)
- Natural language interaction processing with context awareness
- Workflow stage detection and intelligent agent delegation
- Cross-agent state management and result consolidation
- Human-in-the-loop integration points for compliance oversight

**Specialized Domain Agents**
- **MI Agent**: Web search, trend analysis, historical data processing
- **Content Generation Supervisor**: Multi-agent content creation with brand compliance
- **MLR Agent**: Medical/Legal/Regulatory validation with annotation capabilities
- **SF Agent**: Audience segmentation and campaign activation in SFMC

### Core Infrastructure
**LangGraph State Management**
- Persistent conversation context across agent interactions
- Workflow state tracking with audit trail capabilities
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms at each stage
- Performance monitoring and bottleneck identification

**A2A Protocol Implementation**
- Agent discovery and capability registration
- Message routing and response handling between agents
- Protocol compliance validation and error management
- Scalable communication patterns for future agent additions

**Mock Services Architecture**
- RESTful API endpoints mimicking production systems
- Realistic data responses based on actual system schemas
- State persistence for testing complex workflows
- Performance simulation for load testing scenarios

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases

**Phase 1: Core Foundation (4 weeks)**
- Orchestrator Agent with basic coordination capabilities
- A2A protocol implementation and testing framework
- Mock services for Veeva Vault, SFMC, and S3 storage
- Environment setup with API key management
- Basic logging and error handling infrastructure

**Phase 2: Content Intelligence Pipeline (6 weeks)**
- MI Agent with Tavily web search integration
- OpenAI API integration for content theme generation
- Content Generation Supervisor with sub-agent coordination
- Brand guidelines integration and compliance checking
- Content storage system with version control

**Phase 3: Compliance and Activation (6 weeks)**
- MLR Agent with multi-layered compliance validation
- SF Agent for audience segmentation and journey creation
- Feedback loops for iterative content improvement
- Mock SFMC integration with campaign activation
- Status tracking and reporting dashboard

**Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (4 weeks)**
- End-to-end workflow validation and performance testing
- User acceptance testing with pharmaceutical stakeholders
- Security validation and compliance audit
- Production deployment preparation and documentation

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
**API Rate Limiting**: Implement intelligent caching, request queuing, and user feedback
**LLM Hallucination**: Multi-layer validation with confidence scoring and human checkpoints
**Agent Coordination Complexity**: Start with linear workflow, gradually add parallel processing
**Mock Service Accuracy**: Use real API schemas and response patterns for production readiness

### Testing Approach
**Unit Testing**: Individual agent capabilities and tool functionality
**Integration Testing**: Agent-to-agent communication via A2A protocol
**End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflow from ideation to campaign activation
**Performance Testing**: Concurrent user sessions and API response times
**Compliance Testing**: MLR validation accuracy against known pharmaceutical content
